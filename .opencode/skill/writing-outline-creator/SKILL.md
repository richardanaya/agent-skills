# Ayn Rand's Art of Nonfiction: A Complete Guide to Outlining and Writing

*Based on Ayn Rand's 1969 lectures, published posthumously as* The Art of Nonfiction: A Guide for Writers and Readers *(edited by Robert Mayhew)*

---

## Core Philosophy

Rand's central claim: **Writing is a rational skill that can be learned.** It is not mysterious, not dependent on inspiration, and does not have to be torture. What you need for nonfiction writing is what you need for life in general: an orderly method of thinking.

Her equivalent of "plot, plot, and plot" for fiction: **Clarity, clarity, and clarity.**

## The Fundamental Distinctions

### Subject vs. Theme

These are distinct concepts, and you must identify both before writing:

| Concept | Definition | How to State It |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **Subject** | What you want to write about | "I am going to write about..." |
| **Theme** | What you want to *say* about that subject, and what is *new* about it | A single declarative sentence stating your central claim |

**The Rule**: If you have nothing new to say, no matter how brilliantly you can say it, do not do it.

### Plot-Theme (for Fiction)

The **plot-theme** is the link between the abstract theme and the concrete events of a story. It is "the central conflict or situation of a story—a conflict in terms of action, corresponding to the theme and complex enough to create a purposeful progression of events."

- The **theme** is the core of the novel's abstract meaning
- The **plot-theme** is the core of its events

**Example from *Gone With the Wind*:**
- Theme: "The impact of the Civil War on Southern society"
- Plot-theme: "The romantic conflict of a woman who loves a man representing the old order, and is loved by another man, representing the new"

## The Outline: Final Causation

### The Philosophical Foundation

Rand grounds the need for an outline in Aristotle's concept of **final causation**: a purpose is set in advance, and then the steps required to achieve it are determined.

**The Analogy**: If you decide to drive to Chicago, your destination determines which roads you select, how much gas you need, etc. You then execute through *efficient causation* (filling the tank, steering), but the whole process is governed by your purpose.

**Application to Writing**: You set yourself a definite purpose—you name explicitly your subject and theme—and that determines what material to choose. It is final causation that determines what to include both in your outline and in your article.

### What an Outline Is

An outline is **a mental plan of action that names the essential points by which you intend to demonstrate your theme.**

It is:
- A skeleton, not a draft
- A logical structure showing how ideas relate hierarchically
- A standard against which to judge every sentence you write

It is not:
- A list of everything you know about the topic
- A detailed script that predetermines every sentence
- Optional

### The Test for Inclusion

For every point in your outline, ask: **Is this necessary to demonstrate my theme?**

- If you removed it, would the argument collapse or have a gap? → Keep it
- If removing it wouldn't damage the argument? → Cut it

A typical article outline has **3-7 major sections**. If you have 15 points, you probably haven't identified the essentials.

## The Writing Process: Conscious vs. Subconscious

Rand identified **psycho-epistemology**—the study of man's cognitive processes from the aspect of the interaction between the conscious mind and the subconscious—as essential to understanding writing.

### Different Stages, Different Mental Modes

| Stage | Primary Mode | Your Goal |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| **Outlining** | Conscious | Identify logical structure; select what serves your theme |
| **Drafting** | Subconscious | Get words on paper; follow your outline without self-editing |
| **Editing** | Conscious | Read as if written by someone else; assess clarity objectively |

### Critical Rules

**During Drafting:**
- Do not try to do your thinking and your writing at the same time
- Go by your emotions, as if you were writing only for yourself
- Do not criticize or edit yourself
- The subconscious must be in the driver's seat

**During Editing:**
- You must be as objective and impersonal as possible
- Try to forget what you have written and read it as if it were written by someone else
- The conscious mind must be dominant

### The Penalty for Subjectivism

"The penalty for subjectivism in thinking is the inability to distinguish between what is on paper and what is only in your mind."

This is why editing requires reading as a stranger would—you must see what you *actually wrote*, not what you *meant to write*.

---

## Editing in Layers

Rand recommends editing in stages, going over your draft many times from different aspects:

1. **Structure**: Does the logical progression work? Does each section serve the theme?
2. **Clarity**: Does each sentence say what you intend? Will your audience understand it?
3. **Style**: Is the writing vivid? Does it flow?

You cannot do everything at once. Each pass focuses on one dimension.

---

## Judging Your Audience

Before writing, identify:
- What does your audience already know?
- What do they believe about your subject?
- What is their context?

Your job is to **bridge from where they are to where you want to take them**. This determines:
- What you can assume vs. what you must explain
- Where you must address objections or contrary beliefs
- What examples will resonate

---

## Style

**Style is the result of subconscious integration.** You cannot develop a style consciously, but you can:
- Give your subconscious the standing order that you value stylistic color
- Note what you admire in other writers' styles while reading
- Trust that it will emerge naturally when you write freely

This is why drafting must be spontaneous—style comes from lightning-like integrations your subconscious can only make when it is free.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Why It's a Problem |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Floating abstractions** | Readers can't visualize what you mean; ground your writing in concretes |
| **Preaching** | Let your philosophy inform your work, but don't lecture |
| **Hundred-dollar words** | Complexity doesn't equal depth; clarity is the goal |
| **Bromides** | Clichés signal that you haven't thought freshly about your subject |
| **Unnecessary synonyms** | Varying terms for the same concept creates confusion |
| **Sarcasm and inappropriate humor** | These can undermine your argument's seriousness |

---

## Psychological Advice

Rand offers this counsel to writers struggling with self-doubt:

> "The first precondition of this course, and of any type of writing, is: do not get a sense of unearned guilt. If you have difficulty with writing, do not conclude that there is something wrong with you. Writing should never be a test of self-esteem."

> "Never take the blame for something you do not know. Be sure, however, to take the blame for writing errors you do know about. That much is open to your conscious mind, and pertains to how carefully you edit."

> "When you sit down to write, you must regard yourself as perfect, omniscient, and omnipotent."

### The "Squirms"

Rand names the feeling of resistance when something is wrong in your writing "the squirms." This is a signal—something contradicts your purpose. Return to your outline and diagnose the problem.

### "White Tennis Shoes"

Her term for the resistance to starting—the feeling that makes you want to do anything but begin writing. The cure is a clear outline: when you know exactly what you need to accomplish, starting becomes easier.

## Example Outline

### Article: Why Minimum Wage Laws Harm the Workers They Claim to Help

**Subject**: Minimum wage laws

**Theme**: Minimum wage laws harm the very workers they claim to help by making it illegal for low-skilled workers to gain employment and acquire skills.

**Audience**: Educated general reader who accepts the conventional view that minimum wage helps workers; sympathetic to workers but open to economic reasoning.

---

**I. Opening: The Paradox**
- Present the apparent compassion of minimum wage advocacy
- State the contradiction: a law "for" workers that destroys their opportunities
- Thesis: minimum wage laws make it *illegal* to hire workers whose productivity is below the mandated wage

**II. The Nature of Wages**
- Wages are prices—the price of labor
- Prices are determined by supply and demand, but bounded by productivity
- An employer cannot long pay a worker more than that worker produces
- Therefore: a worker whose output is worth $10/hour cannot be legally employed at a $15 minimum

**III. Who Is Affected**
- Not all workers—those with skills above the minimum are unaffected
- The victims: young, inexperienced, unskilled, those with barriers to employment
- These are precisely the workers the law claims to help
- The cruel irony: the law locks out those most in need of a first rung on the ladder

**IV. The Unseen Destruction**
- Jobs not created are invisible
- Skills never acquired compound over a lifetime
- The teenager who never gets a first job never learns workplace habits
- The permanent underclass created by "compassionate" policy

**V. The Beneficiaries**
- Unions (whose contracts often peg wages to minimums)
- Skilled workers (protected from competition by the unskilled)
- Politicians (who gain votes by appearing compassionate)
- Those who benefit are seen; those who are harmed are unseen

**VI. Conclusion**
- Return to the paradox: good intentions, destructive results
- The law does not raise wages—it outlaws employment
- True compassion requires understanding consequences, not merely intentions

---

### Why This Outline Works

| Principle | How It's Applied |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Final causation** | Every point exists to demonstrate the theme; nothing extraneous |
| **Hierarchical structure** | The argument builds: what wages are → who is affected → unseen effects → actual beneficiaries |
| **Subject and theme are distinct** | Subject = minimum wage laws; Theme = the specific claim about harm |
| **Audience context** | Opens by acknowledging conventional view before inverting it |
| **Essential points only** | Six sections, each necessary; removing any would leave a gap |

---

## Summary: The Complete Process

1. **Choose your subject**: What do you want to write about?
2. **Identify your theme**: What do you want to *say* about it? What's new?
3. **Judge your audience**: What is their context? What do they already believe?
4. **Create your outline**: Name the essential points that demonstrate your theme
5. **Write the draft**: Let your subconscious work; don't edit as you go
6. **Set it aside**: Wait at least a day before editing
7. **Edit in layers**: Structure, then clarity, then style
8. **Repeat editing**: Until the draft conveys your theme clearly and persuasively
