# My Coding Agentic Skills

These are my incredibly useful coding agentic skills that supercharge software development workflows. Each skill provides specialized capabilities to enhance productivity, analysis, and automation in coding projects.

## Skills Overview

### 1. Epistemic Extraction
**Description**: An epistemic extraction system that analyzes text to identify its logical structure according to Aristotelian and Objectivist epistemology. Extracts concepts, propositions, and arguments from provided text.

**Why incredibly useful for coding**:
- Analyze complex API documentation to uncover logical dependencies and implicit assumptions
- Extract key concepts from technical specifications, RFCs, or design documents
- Identify logical flaws or gaps in code comments, requirements, or architecture discussions
- Build structured knowledge bases from unstructured technical text
- Validate the coherence of technical arguments in code reviews or proposals

**Real-world examples in coding**:
- Extracting "wisdom nodes" from research papers and technical documentation for AI training and knowledge bases
- Quantifying uncertainty in AI-driven security reconnaissance during penetration testing
- Extracting structured data from unstructured text in software documentation and research papers using LLMs
- Automating requirements analysis by extracting use cases, actors, and relationships from natural language specifications
- Reasoning with epistemic uncertainty in scientific literature reviews for evidence-based development practices

### 2. Writing Outline Creator
**Description**: Creating an outline of a piece of writing according to a strategy of Ayn Rand's art of non-fiction/fiction.

**Why incredibly useful for coding**:
- Structure comprehensive technical documentation and README files
- Plan software architecture documents with clear hierarchical organization
- Create detailed implementation plans for complex features or refactors
- Organize project proposals, RFCs, or change management documents
- Ensure logical flow in API documentation or user guides
- Apply structured thinking to break down large coding tasks into manageable sections

**Real-world examples in coding**:
- Outlining software projects with hierarchical structures, such as e-commerce app features (authentication, database schema, API endpoints)
- Creating code skeletons for algorithms like quicksort with essential components (partition, recursion, base cases)
- Applying Delphi technique for software effort estimation using structured outlines
- Structuring composite pattern implementations with hierarchical tree-like organizations

### 3. Describe Image
**Description**: Uses a local model to describe something about an image.

**Why incredibly useful for coding**:
- Analyze UI mockups, wireframes, and design prototypes
- Extract detailed descriptions from screenshots for bug reports or documentation
- Interpret diagrams, flowcharts, and architecture diagrams in technical docs
- Describe visual elements in code screenshots for pair programming or reviews
- Analyze chart data or graphs from performance monitoring tools
- Process visual assets for accessibility compliance or alt-text generation

**Real-world examples in coding**:
- Using VisionTool in CrewAI to analyze UI screenshots and identify bugs or layout issues in development workflows
- Generating alt text and content labels for images in apps using Azure Computer Vision for WCAG compliance
- Analyzing diagrams and flowcharts with GenaiScript to explain architecture in technical documentation
- Scanning repository images with README-AI to generate descriptions for automated documentation
- Describing mobile image buttons with context-aware GPT-4V for accurate UX accessibility

### 4. Generate Image
**Description**: Generate images with nano banana pro and FAL for high-quality visual content creation.

**Why incredibly useful for coding**:
- Create UI mockups, icons, and visual assets for software projects
- Generate illustrations and concept art for presentations or documentation
- Produce placeholder images for prototyping and development
- Create custom graphics for branding or marketing materials
- Generate diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate code architecture
- Build visual examples for tutorials or API documentation

**Real-world examples in coding**:
- Using AI SDKs like Vercel AI to generate interface mockups for web/mobile apps
- Generating game assets and textures with Stable Diffusion for prototyping
- Creating product images and ad creatives for enterprise software interfaces
- Producing hero images and UI elements with Flux models for web layouts
- Automating visual asset pipelines in agent-based software development
- Generating sprites, textures, and animations for game prototyping in Unity Muse
- Creating game box art and character assets in AWS Agentic Arcade
- Producing 3D models from text prompts for rapid game development with Ludo.ai

### 5. Interact with Browser
**Description**: A CLI for interacting with browser, providing comprehensive browser automation capabilities.

**Why incredibly useful for coding**:
- Automate end-to-end testing of web applications
- Perform web scraping and data collection for development tasks
- Debug and verify frontend functionality across different browsers
- Automate repetitive web-based workflows in development pipelines
- Test responsive design and cross-browser compatibility
- Interact with web APIs and services during development
- Capture screenshots and accessibility information for documentation

**Real-world examples in coding**:
- Generating automated scripts by recording user actions with Playwright's codegen for creating interaction tests
- Capturing full-page screenshots and PDFs with Puppeteer for documentation and design reviews
- Performing authenticated scraping with agent-browser for protected content in development
- Running cross-browser E2E tests with Playwright in CI/CD pipelines
- Using crawl4ai for headless scraping of dynamic sites at scale

### 6. Playwright
**Description**: Browser automation via Playwright MCP - comprehensive verification, browsing, information gathering, web scraping, testing, screenshots, and all browser interactions.

**Why incredibly useful for coding**:
- Write robust end-to-end tests for web applications
- Automate cross-browser testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Perform web scraping and data extraction for integration tasks
- Generate screenshots and videos for visual regression testing
- Test mobile web applications with device emulation
- Automate authentication flows and user interactions
- Debug complex web application behaviors programmatically

**Real-world examples in coding**:
- Testing user flows and UI interactions in Elementor WordPress plugin with auto-waiting for elements
- Scraping product data from e-commerce sites using headless Chromium with proxy support
- Capturing full-page screenshots for visual regression testing and documentation
- Integrating with LangChain agents for automated web interactions in AI workflows
- Using Playwright in CI/CD pipelines for reliable cross-browser compatibility testing
